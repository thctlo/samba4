Debian Stretch, the minimal things for a MEMBER server. 
( debian stretch samba 4.5.8/4.5.12 )

Part 1 The "Samba MEMBER" (FILE-SERVER) server setup.

Now for an Samba member server, we need the following. 
- Correct hostname and resolving ( see part-1-checkup )
- Correct time for the server and network 
- Internet

Now we install the following, and this setups the following. 

Samba (member) 
Time server (client)

# the needed packages
#apt-get install samba winbind   	# For samba with Samba internal DNS
# Or
# apt-get install samba winbind bind9 # For samba with Bind BIND9_DLZ DNS 
#
# I noticed attr is selected but not acl for the install, 
# so to make sure these are installed. 
#apt-get install attr acl 
#
# if you want to ssh and/or have uid/gid resolving 
# ( adviced is yes, pleas install this. )
#apt-get install libnss-winbind libpam-winbind
#
# tools  ( optional, but very handy to have them installed )
#apt-get install bind9utils ldb-tools 

# python-gpgme is added when you install a samba 4.6.x+ 

# smbclient is added also for the tests later on.

# Now all in one go. 
apt-get install samba winbind acl libnss-winbind libpam-winbind \
 ntp krb5-user bind9utils ldb-tools smbclient -y

#### For the questions .. 
# Configuring Kerberos Authentication 
### You kan keep the default ( DNS domain in caps ). (INTERNAL.EXAMPLE.COM)
### Just keep in mind DNS domain != REALM 
# Configuring Kerberos Authentication
### Empty is ok, just hit enter

##############################################################################
Now its getting interesting and first we disble the things we dont need. 

lets stop all services first we are going to configure. 
systemctl stop samba smbd nmbd winbind samba-ad-dc ntp

# See the status of the services: 
systemctl status samba smbd nmbd winbind samba-ad-dc ntp

# disable the "AD DC server startups"
systemctl mask samba samba-ad-dc
systemctl disable  samba samba-ad-dc

# set samba-ad-dc ready to start, but DONT start it yet. 
systemctl unmask smbd nmbd winbind
systemctl enable smbd nmbd winbind
systemctl stop smbd nmbd winbind

### NTP Begin ( Part 1/2 )
cp /etc/ntp.conf{,.org-debian}

# Now first setup the time server and make sure time is correct,
# before we do something with samba.
#
# Disable the pool servers.

sed -i 's/pool 3.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst/#pool 3.debian.pool.ntp.org iburst/g' /etc/ntp.conf

# For the Member server we point to the DC (1 or 2 or 3).
# change YOUR_DC_NAME_OR_IP to the hostname of ip adres of your DC.
sed -i 's/#server ntp.your-provider.example/server YOUR_DC_NAME_OR_IP/g' /etc/ntp.conf

cat << EOF >> /etc/ntp.conf
#
# Optional, define which interface ntp could/should use.
# Since SystemD, we dont have Predictable interface names anymore. 
# Info: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/
# run : ip a and check you interface name and change it. ( default = eth0 )
# Enable/disable what you want, its here as example for you.
# Notice: if you run : ntpq -p or ntpstat  ( apt-get install ntpstat )
# and you keep getting unsync messages, try disable-ing all the interface lines first and restart ntp
# If ntp tries to connect to ipv6 and its disabled, it wont sync. 
# test: systemctl stop ntp && strace ntpq -pn ::1|& grep -i conn
#interface listen lo
#interface listen eth0
#interface ignore wildcard
#interface ignore ipv6
#
EOF
systemctl restart ntp 
# and see if everything is running
